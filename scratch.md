##Programming Graphics

Personal goals for this chapter are to:
* Explain the basics in a way so as to not lose anyone who is just picking up programming
* Explain one process for thinking about generating visuals algorithmically 
* Demonstrate some ways to get your work off of your computer and into the interwebs
* And [hopefully] also include interesting things for those who are more advanced
